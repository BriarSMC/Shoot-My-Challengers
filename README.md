# Milanote
We originaly were going to use the Github Repository's wiki for technical documenatation. It still exists in an
incomplete form. We found this too unwieldly for game development. We now use Milanote for the game's technical
documentation. This documentation can be seen at:

# Wiki
We use the [Wiki](https://github.com/BriarSMC/Shoot-My-Challengers/wiki) attached to this repository for this project's development documents. You may
edit those documents within GitHub's Wiki editor, or copy the  Markdown text to your local computer
to edit them there, and copy/paste them back into the Wiki editor.
