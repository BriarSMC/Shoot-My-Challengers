extends Weapon
class_name HeroSWeapon

# This class is for the Hero's secondary weapon: A bomb
#
# The Hero will drop this bomb and it will stay at that location until
# it detonates. It has a blast radius. All Challengers in that radius 
# receive damage. Through magic shielding, the bomb does not damage
# the Hero.
#
# Since we won't be dropping a bizillion bombs at once, we will not use
# pooling for this weapon. Therefore, the DetentationTimer can autostart.
# It also is a one-shot because, well, it blows itself up!
