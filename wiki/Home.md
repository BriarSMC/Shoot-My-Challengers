This wiki contains documentation on the design, development, testing, deployment, and support for Shoot My Challengers (SMC)

# Notes on this Wiki

I started this Wiki thinking I could keep the game's development documentation here. Noble thought. Bad idea. Several problems have
raised their tiny, ugly heads. 

## Too Long
Some of these docs, like the GDD, are __WAY__ too long. A bitch and a half to maintain, and makes for difficult reading. 

## Graphics, Images, and the such
GitHub's Wiki Markdown syntax allows us to include .png, .gif, etc. in the document. Way cool. All you need is a URL to the file. 
GitHub even has a way to include these files right from the repository. And it works great! In the Wiki, but not other formats
like PDF. Turns out when you use the URL to a file in the repository, it really doesn't return the file. It returns an HTML page. The Wiki 
somehow figures out what to do. We want to convert some of these docs to PDF. So we can't use the GitHub URL links.

So I have created the URL `https://coghillclan.net/ImageLibrary/ShootMyChallenger/images/` to store these images. This way my PDF converter
can load the files.
